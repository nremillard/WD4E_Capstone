				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>We all have our favorite things, colors, movies, foods, and so much more. In creating a responsive design for a Capstone project in HTML, I have decided to share with you some fun information about my 3 favorite animals.</p>

				<h2>Honorary Mentions</h2>
				<p>The Animal Kingdom is made up of millions of different species of fauna; however, I am no biologist or expert and I limited space to provide you with information I found online. While I will only give you 3 animals and their fun-facts, here are some honorary mentions for my favorite animals. This is a Koala, I am not too sure what it is but good news, it does not seem it knows either.</p>

				<h2>Another Honorary Mention</h2>
				<p>I think that it is pretty well-known that all the goodest boys and all the goodest girls in the animal kingdom are wagging their tails, so tell your dog I said "Hi."</p>
